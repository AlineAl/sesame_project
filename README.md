## üíæ Step by step

This project is a project that has not been completed and which was a necessary training so that I could reuse all the logic put in place during my training at Openclassrooms.

I spent hours and days on it, but this project is the one that helped me the most to visualize all the work that could represent the design of a website, and more particularly, a blog. I gave myself the opportunity to use technologies for which I want to specialize (React for example). Thanks to this project I was able to manipulate react-router, understand its functioning as well as that of the react-hook in connection with axios to retrieve and create data.

The person who proposed this blog project to me didn't know what she wanted as a design for her blog. Despite the fact that I have no notion in the field, I decided to start using Figma. In agreement with the person, I embarked on the responsive model of the different pages. I also took the time to think about specifications, what I could use to get started.

After some research, I chose to use a Headless CMS, Strapi, because it is open-source and it seemed to me quite simple for a first start. I liked the documentation and I was able to quickly configure a backend with a database (PostgreSQL). I was thus able to put the administrator interface into production on Heroku (https://sesameoeuvretoiadmin.herokuapp.com/admin/auth/login) after having decided locally on the elements I would need. I was able to integrate the schema that would be set up in the database.

I focused on the frontend for the rest of the project. I manipulated for the first time and discovered the whole point of react-hook. To make the link between the backend and the frontend, I used Axios. I'm comfortable with this tool and it's very easy to implement in code. It allows for efficient and clean code. I tried, despite still some flaws in this project, to think about using a clean and maintainable code in the long term. This made it easier for me to find myself when I wasn't coding on the blog for a while.

I also noticed that my images weren't persisting to the cloud with Heroku. This is how I used Cloudinary so that I could have a storage space for my images. Doing this project was rich in these discoveries, it made me think of things I hadn't thought of before.

It is currently suspended because the person having committed to something else and other more concrete projects have been offered to me. I therefore devote myself fully to these but I will certainly return to finish what I started to obtain a clean work of which I can be proud.

## üîå Points to improve

‚òê Making a table for each item category of article was poorly thought out. If I had to do it again I would create a "category" table directly and I would try to do it differently to retrieve the data.

‚òê Do not hesitate to use a css framework which would have allowed a cleaner responsive. There are also some flaws due to the fact that I would have had to think of the code differently on some pages.

‚òê No more repeating code. I realized that I used for example the navbar on each page. It would have been necessary to make a separate file and export it.

‚òê The performance of the site is too long. We will have to consider reworking this.
